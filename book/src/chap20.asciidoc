== The Goodies: Base

Julia +Base+ contains a range of functions, types and macros appropriate for performing scientific and numerical computing, but is also as broad as those of many general purpose programming languages. Additional functionality is available from the Standard Library and a growing collection of available packages.

This chapter is not a replacement of the offical Julia documentation. I give merely some examples to illustrate what is possible without being exhaustive. 

The structure of this chapter mimics the corresponding part of the official Julia documentation.
