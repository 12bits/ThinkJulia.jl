If you run the program again, it starts with a clean slate.</p><p>Other programs are <strong>persistent</strong>: they run for a long time (or all the time); they keep at least some of their data in permanent storage (a hard drive, for example); and if they shut down and restart, they pick up where they left off.</p><p>Examples of persistent programs are operating systems, which run pretty much whenever a computer is on, and web servers, which run all the time, waiting for requests to come in on the network.</p><p>One of the simplest ways for programs to maintain their data is by reading and writing text files. We have already seen programs that read text files; in this chapter we will see programs that write them.</p><p>An alternative is to store the state of the program in a database. In this chapter I will present a simple database and a module, <code>JLD2</code>, that makes it easy to store program data.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Reading-and-writing-1" href="#Reading-and-writing-1">Reading and writing</a></h2><p>A text file is a sequence of characters stored on a permanent medium like a hard drive, flash memory, or CD-ROM. We saw how to open and read a file in Section 9.1.</p><p>To write a file, you have to open it with mode <code>&quot;w&quot;</code> as a second parameter:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; fout = open(&quot;output.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;)
IOStream(&lt;file output.txt&gt;)</code></pre><p>If the file already exists, opening it in write mode clears out the old data and starts fresh, so be careful! If the file doesn’t exist, a new one is created. <code>open</code> returns a file object and the <code>write</code> function puts data into the file.</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; line1 = &quot;This here&#39;s the wattle,\n&quot;;

julia&gt; write(fout, line1)
24</code></pre><p>The return value is the number of characters that were written. The file object keeps track of where it is, so if you call <code>write</code> again, it adds the new data to the end of the file.</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; line2 = &quot;the emblem of our land.\n&quot;;

julia&gt; write(fout, line2)
24</code></pre><p>When you are done writing, you should close the file.</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; close(fout)
</code></pre><p>If you don’t close the file, it gets closed for you when the program ends.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Formatting-1" href="#Formatting-1">Formatting</a></h2><p>The argument of write has to be a string, so if we want to put other values in a file, we have to convert them to strings. The easiest way to do that is with <code>string</code> or string interpolation:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; fout = open(&quot;output.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;)
IOStream(&lt;file output.txt&gt;)
julia&gt; write(fout, string(150))
3</code></pre><p>An alternative is to use the <code>print(ln)</code> family of functions.</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; camels = 42
42
julia&gt; println(fout, &quot;I have spotted $camels camels.&quot;)
</code></pre><p>A more powerful alternative is the <code>@printf</code> macro that prints using a C style format specification string, which you can read about at <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/stdlib/io-network/#Base.Printf.@printf">https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/stdlib/io-network/#Base.Printf.@printf</a></p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Filenames-and-paths-1" href="#Filenames-and-paths-1">Filenames and paths</a></h2><p>Files are organized into <strong>directories</strong> (also called “folders”). Every running program has a “current directory”, which is the default directory for most operations. For example, when you open a file for reading, Python looks for it in the current directory.</p><p>The function <code>pwd</code> returns the name of the current directory:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; cwd = pwd()
&quot;/home/dinsdale&quot;</code></pre><p><code>cwd</code> stands for “current working directory”. The result in this example is <code>/home/dinsdale</code>, which is the home directory of a user named <code>dinsdale</code>.</p><p>A string like <code>&quot;/home/dinsdale&quot;</code> that identifies a file or directory is called a <strong>path</strong>.</p><p>A simple filename, like <code>memo.txt</code> is also considered a path, but it is a <strong>relative path</strong> because it relates to the current directory. If the current directory is <code>/home/dinsdale</code>, the filename <code>memo.txt</code> would refer to <code>/home/dinsdale/memo.txt</code>.</p><p>A path that begins with <code>/</code> does not depend on the current directory; it is called an <strong>absolute path</strong>. To find the absolute path to a file, you can use <code>abspath</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; abspath(&quot;memo.txt&quot;)
&quot;/home/dinsdale/memo.txt&quot;</code></pre><p>Julia provides other functions for working with filenames and paths. For example, <code>ispath</code> checks whether a file or directory exists:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; ispath(&quot;memo.txt&quot;)
true

If it exists, `isdir` checks whether it’s a directory:
</code></pre><p>julia-repl julia&gt; isdir(&quot;memo.txt&quot;) false julia&gt; isdir(&quot;/home/dinsdale&quot;) true</p><pre><code class="language-none">
Similarly, `isfile` checks whether it’s a file.

`readdir` returns a list of the files (and other directories) in the given directory:
</code></pre><p>julia-repl julia&gt; readdir(cwd) 3-element Array{String,1}:  &quot;memo.txt&quot;  &quot;music&quot;  &quot;photos&quot;</p><pre><code class="language-none">
To demonstrate these functions, the following example “walks” through a directory, prints the names of all the files, and calls itself recursively on all the directories.
</code></pre><p>julia function walk(dirname)     for name in readdir(dirname)         path = joinpath(dirname, name)         if isfile(path)             println(path)         else             walk(path)         end     end end</p><pre><code class="language-none">
`joinpath` takes a directory and a file name and joins them into a complete path.

Julia provides a function called `walkdir` (see &lt;https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/stdlib/file/#Base.Filesystem.walkdir&gt;) that is similar to this one but more versatile. As an exercise, read the documentation and use it to print the names of the files in a given directory and its subdirectories.

## Catching exceptions

A lot of things can go wrong when you try to read and write files. If you try to open a file that doesn’t exist, you get a `SystemError`:
</code></pre><p>@repl fin = open(&quot;bad_file&quot;)</p><pre><code class="language-none">
If you don’t have permission to access a file:
</code></pre><p>@repl fout = open(&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;, &quot;w&quot;)</p><pre><code class="language-none">
To avoid these errors, you could use functions like `ispath` and `isfile`, but it would take a lot of time and code to check all the possibilities.

It is better to go ahead and try—and deal with problems if they happen—which is exactly what the `try` statement does. The syntax is similar to an `if` statement:
</code></pre><p>julia try     fin = open(&quot;bad_file.txt&quot;) catch exc     println(&quot;Something went wrong: exc&quot;) end</p><pre><code class="language-none">
Julia starts by executing the `try` clause. If all goes well, it skips the `catch` clause and proceeds. If an exception occurs, it jumps out of the `try` clause and runs the `catch` clause.

Handling an exception with a `try` statement is called **catching** an exception. In this example, the except clause prints an error message that is not very helpful. In general, catching an exception gives you a chance to fix the problem, or try again, or at least end the program gracefully.

In code that performs state changes or uses resources like files, there is typically clean-up work (such as closing files) that needs to be done when the code is finished. Exceptions potentially complicate this task, since they can cause a block of code to exit before reaching its normal end. The `finally` keyword provides a way to run some code when a given block of code exits, regardless of how it exits:
</code></pre><p>julia f = open(&quot;output.txt&quot;) try     line = readline(f)     println(line) finally     close(f) end</p><pre><code class="language-none">
The function `close` will always be executed.

## Databases

A **database** is a file that is organized for storing data. Many databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference between a database and a dictionary is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists after the program ends.

ThinkJulia provides an interface to `GDBM` for creating and updating database files. As an example, I’ll create a database that contains captions for image files.

Opening a database is similar to opening other files:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; db = DBM(&quot;captions&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) DBM(&lt;captions&gt;)</p><pre><code class="language-none">
The mode &quot;c&quot; means that the database should be created if it doesn’t already exist. The result is a database object that can be used (for most operations) like a dictionary.

When you create a new item, `GDBM` updates the database file:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; db[&quot;cleese.png&quot;] = &quot;Photo of John Cleese.&quot; &quot;Photo of John Cleese.&quot;</p><pre><code class="language-none">
When you access one of the items, `GDBM` reads the file:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; db[&quot;cleese.png&quot;] &quot;Photo of John Cleese.&quot;</p><pre><code class="language-none">
If you make another assignment to an existing key, `GDBM` replaces the old value:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; db[&quot;cleese.png&quot;] = &quot;Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.&quot; &quot;Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.&quot; julia&gt; db[&quot;cleese.png&quot;] &quot;Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.&quot;</p><pre><code class="language-none">
Some functions having a dictionary as argument, like `keys` and `values`, don’t work with database objects. But iteration with a `for` loop works:
</code></pre><p>julia for (key, value) in db     println(key, &quot;: &quot;, value) end</p><pre><code class="language-none">
As with other files, you should close the database when you are done:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; close(db)</p><pre><code class="language-none">
## Serialization

A limitation of `GDBM` is that the keys and the values have to be strings or byte arrays. If you try to use any other type, you get an error.

The functions `serialize` and `deserialize` can help. They translate almost any type of object into a byte array suitable for storage in a database, and then translates byte arrays back into objects:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; using Serialization</p><p>julia&gt; io = IOBuffer();</p><p>julia&gt; t = [1, 2, 3];</p><p>julia&gt; serialize(io, t) 24 julia&gt; print(take!(io)) UInt8[0x37, 0x4a, 0x4c, 0x07, 0x04, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x15, 0x00, 0x08, 0xe2, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]</p><pre><code class="language-none">
The format isn’t obvious to human readers; it is meant to be easy for Julia to interpret. `deserialize` reconstitutes the object:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; io = IOBuffer();</p><p>julia&gt; t1 = [1, 2, 3];</p><p>julia&gt; serialize(io, t1) 24 julia&gt; s = take!(io);</p><p>julia&gt; t2 = deserialize(IOBuffer(s));</p><p>julia&gt; print(t2) [1, 2, 3]</p><pre><code class="language-none">
`serialize` and `deserialize` write to and read from a iobuffer object which represents an in-memory I/O stream. The function `take!` fetches the contents of the iobuffer as a byte array and resets the iobuffer to its initial state.

Although the new object has the same value as the old, it is not (in general) the same object:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; t1 == t2 true julia&gt; t1 ≡ t2 false</p><pre><code class="language-none">
In other words, serialization and then deserialization has the same effect as copying the object.

You can use this to store non-strings in a database. In fact, this combination is so common that it has been encapsulated in a package called `JLD(2)`.

## Command objects

Most operating systems provide a command-line interface, also known as a **shell**. Shells usually provide commands to navigate the file system and launch applications. For example, in Unix you can change directories with `cd`, display the contents of a directory with `ls`, and launch a web browser by typing (for example) `firefox`.

Any program that you can launch from the shell can also be launched from Julia using a **command object**:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; cmd = <code>echo hello</code> <code>echo hello</code></p><pre><code class="language-none">
Backticks are used to delimit the command.

The function `run` executes the command:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; run(cmd); hello</p><pre><code class="language-none">
The `hello` is the output of the echo command, sent to `STDOUT`. The `run` function itself returns a process object, and throws an `ErrorException` if the external command fails to run successfully.

If you want to read the output of the external command, `readstring` can be used instead:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; a = read(cmd, String) &quot;hello\n&quot;</p><pre><code class="language-none">
For example, most Unix systems provide a command called `md5sum` that reads the contents of a file and computes a “checksum”. You can read about MD5 at &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5&gt;. This command provides an efficient way to check whether two files have the same contents. The probability that different contents yield the same checksum is very small (that is, unlikely to happen before the universe collapses).

You can use a command object to run `md5sum` from Julia and get the result:
</code></pre><p>julia-repl julia&gt; filename = &quot;book.tex&quot; &quot;book.tex&quot; julia&gt; cmd = <code>md5sum $filename</code> <code>md5sum book.tex</code> julia&gt; res = readstring(cmd) &quot;d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e  book.tex\n&quot;</p><pre><code class="language-none">
## Modules

Any file that contains Julia code can be imported as a module. For example, suppose you have a file named `&quot;wc.jl&quot;` with the following code:
</code></pre><p>julia function linecount(filename)     count = 0     for line in readline(filename)         count += 1     end     count end</p><p>print(linecount(&quot;wc.jl&quot;))</p><pre><code class="language-none">
If you run this program, it reads itself and prints the number of lines in the file, which is 9. You can also include it like this:
</code></pre><p>julia-repl julia&gt; include(&quot;wc.jl&quot;) 9</p><pre><code class="language-none">
Modules in Julia are separate variable workspaces, i.e. they introduce a new global scope. They are delimited syntactically, inside `module ...  end`. Modules allow you to create top-level definitions without worrying about name conflicts when your code is used together with somebody else&#39;s. Within a module, you can control which names from other modules are visible (via `import`ing), and specify which of your names are intended to be public (via `export`ing).
</code></pre><p>julia module LineCount     export linecount</p><pre><code class="language-none">function linecount(filename)
    count = 0
    for line in eachline(filename)
        count += 1
    end
    count
end</code></pre><p>end</p><pre><code class="language-none">
The module `LineCount` object provides `linecount`:
</code></pre><p>julia-repl julia&gt; using LineCount</p><p>julia&gt; linecount(&quot;wc.jl&quot;) 11</p><pre><code class="language-none">
As an exercise, type this example into a file named `wc.jl`, include it into the REPL and enter `using LineCount`.

Warning: If you import a module that has already been imported, Julia does nothing. It does not re-read the file, even if it has changed.

If you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function `reload`, but it can be tricky, so the safest thing to do is restart the REPL.

## Debugging

When you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems with whitespace. These errors can be hard to debug because spaces, tabs and newlines are normally invisible:
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; s = &quot;1 2\t 3\n 4&quot;;</p><p>julia&gt; println(s) 1 2	 3  4</p><pre><code class="language-none">
The built-in function `repr` can help. It takes any object as an argument and returns a string representation of the object.

This can be helpful for debugging.
</code></pre><p>jldoctest chap14 julia&gt; repr(s) &quot;\&quot;1 2\t 3\n 4\&quot;&quot; ```</p><p>One other problem you might run into is that different systems use different characters to indicate the end of a line. Some systems use a newline, represented <code>\n</code>. Others use a return character, represented <code>\r</code>. Some use both. If you move files between different systems, these inconsistencies can cause problems.</p><p>For most systems, there are applications to convert from one format to another. You can find them (and read more about this issue) at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline</a>.
