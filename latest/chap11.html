Dictionaries are one of Julia’s best features; they are the building blocks of many efficient and elegant algorithms.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="A-dictionary-is-a-mapping-1" href="#A-dictionary-is-a-mapping-1">A dictionary is a mapping</a></h2><p>A <strong>dictionary</strong> is like an array, but more general. In an array, the indices have to be integers; in a dictionary they can be (almost) any type.</p><p>A dictionary contains a collection of indices, which are called <strong>keys</strong>, and a collection of values. Each key is associated with a single value. The association of a key and a value is called a <strong>key-value pair</strong> or sometimes an item.</p><p>In mathematical language, a dictionary represents a <strong>mapping</strong> from keys to values, so you can also say that each key “maps to” a value. As an example, we’ll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all strings.</p><p>The function <code>Dict</code> creates a new dictionary with no items. Because <code>Dict</code> is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; eng2sp = Dict()
Dict{Any,Any} with 0 entries</code></pre><p>The kind of dictionary is surrounded by curly brackets: the keys are of type <code>Any</code> and also the values are of type <code>Any</code>.</p><p>The dictionary is empty. To add items to the dictionary, you can use square brackets:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; eng2sp[&quot;one&quot;] = &quot;uno&quot;;
</code></pre><p>This line creates an item that maps from the key &quot;one&quot; to the value &quot;uno&quot;. If we print the dictionary again, we see a key-value pair with an arrow &quot;=&gt;&quot; between the key and value:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; eng2sp
Dict{Any,Any} with 1 entry:
  &quot;one&quot; =&gt; &quot;uno&quot;</code></pre><p>This output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary with three items:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; eng2sp = Dict(&quot;one&quot; =&gt; &quot;uno&quot;, &quot;two&quot; =&gt; &quot;dos&quot;, &quot;three&quot; =&gt; &quot;tres&quot;)
Dict{String,String} with 3 entries:
  &quot;two&quot;   =&gt; &quot;dos&quot;
  &quot;one&quot;   =&gt; &quot;uno&quot;
  &quot;three&quot; =&gt; &quot;tres&quot;</code></pre><p>The order of the key-value pairs might not be the same. If you type the same example on your computer, you might get a different result. In general, the order of items in a dictionary is unpredictable.</p><p>But that’s not a problem because the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with integer indices. Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; eng2sp[&quot;two&quot;]
&quot;dos&quot;</code></pre><p>The key &quot;two&quot; always maps to the value &quot;dos&quot; so the order of the items doesn’t matter.</p><p>If the key isn’t in the dictionary, you get an exception:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; eng2sp[&quot;four&quot;]
ERROR: KeyError: key &quot;four&quot; not found</code></pre><p>The <code>length</code> function works on dictionaries; it returns the number of key-value pairs:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; length(eng2sp)
3</code></pre><p>The function <code>keys</code> returns an array with the keys of the dictionary:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; ks = keys(eng2sp);

julia&gt; print(ks)
[&quot;two&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;three&quot;]</code></pre><p>Now you can use the <code>∈</code> operator to see whether something appears as a <em>key</em> in the dictionary:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; &quot;one&quot; ∈ ks
true
julia&gt; &quot;uno&quot; ∈ ks
false</code></pre><p>To see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you can use the function <code>values</code>, which returns a collection of values, and then use the <code>∈</code> operator:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; vs = values(eng2sp);

julia&gt; &quot;uno&quot; ∈ vs
true</code></pre><p>The <code>∈</code> operator uses different algorithms for arrays and dictionaries. For arrays, it searches the elements of the array in order, as in Section 8.6. As the array gets longer, the search time gets longer in direct proportion.</p><p>For dictionaries, Julia uses an algorithm called a <strong>hashtable</strong> that has a remarkable property: the <code>∈</code> operator takes about the same amount of time no matter how many items are in the dictionary.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Dictionary-as-a-collection-of-counters-1" href="#Dictionary-as-a-collection-of-counters-1">Dictionary as a collection of counters</a></h2><p>Suppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each letter appears. There are several ways you could do it:</p><ul><li><p>You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you could traverse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, probably using a chained conditional.</p></li><li><p>You could create an array with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to a number (using the built-in function <code>Int</code>), use the number as an index into the array, and increment the appropriate counter.</p></li><li><p>You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the corresponding values. The first time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary. After that you would increment the value of an existing item.</p></li></ul><p>Each of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements that computation in a different way.</p><p>An <strong>implementation</strong> is a way of performing a computation; some implementations are better than others. For example, an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we don’t have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the string and we only have to make room for the letters that do appear.</p><p>Here is what the code might look like:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function histogram(s)
    d = Dict()
    for c in s
        if c ∉ keys(d)
            d[c] = 1
        else
            d[c] += 1
        end
    end
    d
end</code></pre><p>The name of the function is <code>histogram</code>, which is a statistical term for a collection of counters (or frequencies).</p><p>The first line of the function creates an empty dictionary. The <code>for</code> loop traverses the string. Each time through the loop, if the character <code>c</code> is not in the dictionary, we create a new item with key <code>c</code> and the initial value <code>1</code> (since we have seen this letter once). If <code>c</code> is already in the dictionary we increment <code>d[c]</code>.</p><p>Here’s how it works:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; h = histogram(&quot;brontosaurus&quot;)
Dict{Any,Any} with 8 entries:
  &#39;n&#39; =&gt; 1
  &#39;s&#39; =&gt; 2
  &#39;a&#39; =&gt; 1
  &#39;r&#39; =&gt; 2
  &#39;t&#39; =&gt; 1
  &#39;o&#39; =&gt; 2
  &#39;u&#39; =&gt; 2
  &#39;b&#39; =&gt; 1</code></pre><p>The histogram indicates that the letters <code>&#39;a&#39;</code> and <code>&#39;b&#39;</code> appear once; <code>&#39;o&#39;</code> appears twice, and so on.</p><p>Dictionaries have a function called <code>get</code> that takes a key and a default value. If the key appears in the dictionary, <code>get</code> returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default value. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; h = histogram(&quot;a&quot;)
Dict{Any,Any} with 1 entry:
  &#39;a&#39; =&gt; 1
julia&gt; get(h, &#39;a&#39;, 0)
1
julia&gt; get(h, &#39;b&#39;, 0)
0</code></pre><p>As an exercise, use <code>get</code> to write <code>histogram</code> more concisely. You should be able to eliminate the <code>if</code> statement.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Looping-and-dictionaries-1" href="#Looping-and-dictionaries-1">Looping and dictionaries</a></h2><p>You can traverse the keys of the dictionary in a <code>for</code> statement. For example, <code>printhist</code> prints each key and the corresponding value:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function printhist(h)
    for c in keys(h)
        println(c, &quot; &quot;, h[c])
    end
end</code></pre><p>Here’s what the output looks like:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; h = histogram(&quot;parrot&quot;);

julia&gt; printhist(h)
a 1
r 2
p 1
o 1
t 1</code></pre><p>Again, the keys are in no particular order. To traverse the keys in sorted order, you can combine <code>sort!</code> and <code>collect</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; for c in sort!(collect(keys(h)))
           println(c, &quot; &quot;, h[c])
       end
a 1
o 1
p 1
r 2
t 1</code></pre><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Reverse-lookup-1" href="#Reverse-lookup-1">Reverse lookup</a></h2><p>Given a dictionary <code>d</code> and a key <code>k</code>, it is easy to find the corresponding value <code>v = d[k]</code>. This operation is called a <strong>lookup</strong>.</p><p>But what if you have <code>v</code> and you want to find <code>k</code>? You have two problems: first, there might be more than one key that maps to the value <code>v</code>. Depending on the application, you might be able to pick one, or you might have to make an array that contains all of them. Second, there is no simple syntax to do a <strong>reverse lookup</strong>; you have to search.</p><p>Here is a function that takes a value and returns the first key that maps to that value:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function reverselookup(d, v)
    for k in keys(d)
        if d[k] == v
            return k
        end
    end
    error(&quot;LookupError&quot;)
end</code></pre><p>This function is yet another example of the search pattern, but it uses a function we haven’t seen before, <code>error</code>. The <code>error</code> function is used to produce an <code>ErrorException</code> that interrupts the normal flow of control. In this case it has the message <code>&quot;LookupError&quot;</code>, indicating that a key does not exist.</p><p>If we get to the end of the loop, that means <code>v</code> doesn’t appear in the dictionary as a value, so we throw an exception.</p><p>Here is an example of a successful reverse lookup:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; h = histogram(&quot;parrot&quot;);

julia&gt; key = reverselookup(h, 2)
&#39;r&#39;: ASCII/Unicode U+0072 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)</code></pre><p>And an unsuccessful one:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; key = reverselookup(h, 3)
ERROR: LookupError</code></pre><p>The effect when you generate an exception is the same as when Julia throws one: it prints a traceback and an error message.</p><p>A reverse lookup is much slower than a forward lookup; if you have to do it often, or if the dictionary gets big, the performance of your program will suffer.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Dictionaries-and-arrays-1" href="#Dictionaries-and-arrays-1">Dictionaries and arrays</a></h2><p>Arrays can appear as values in a dictionary. For example, if you are given a dictionary that maps from letters to frequencies, you might want to invert it; that is, create a dictionary that maps from frequencies to letters. Since there might be several letters with the same frequency, each value in the inverted dictionary should be an array of letters.</p><p>Here is a function that inverts a dictionary:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function invertdict(d)
    inverse = Dict()
    for key in keys(d)
        val = d[key]
        if val ∉ keys(inverse)
            inverse[val] = [key]
        else
            push!(inverse[val], key)
        end
    end
    inverse
end</code></pre><p>Each time through the loop, <code>key</code> gets a key from <code>d</code> and <code>val</code> gets the corresponding value. If <code>val</code> is not in <code>inverse</code>, that means we haven’t seen it before, so we create a new item and initialize it with a <strong>singleton</strong> (an array that contains a single element). Otherwise we have seen this value before, so we append the corresponding key to the array.</p><p>Here is an example:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; hist = histogram(&quot;parrot&quot;);

julia&gt; inverse = invertdict(hist)
Dict{Any,Any} with 2 entries:
  2 =&gt; [&#39;r&#39;]
  1 =&gt; [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;p&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;t&#39;]</code></pre><figure>
  <img src="fig111.svg" alt="State diagram.">
  <figcaption>Figure 11.1. State diagram.</figcaption>
</figure><p>Figure 11.1 is a state diagram showing <code>hist</code> and <code>inverse</code>. A dictionary is represented as a box with the key-value pairs inside. If the values are integers, floats or strings, I draw them inside the box, but I usually draw arrays outside the box, just to keep the diagram simple.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that a dictionary is implemented using a hashtable and that means that the keys have to be <strong>hashable</strong>.</p><p>A <strong>hash</strong> is a function that takes a value (of any kind) and returns an integer. Dictionaries use these integers, called hash values, to store and look up key-value pairs.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Memos-1" href="#Memos-1">Memos</a></h2><p>If you played with the <code>fibonacci</code> function from Section 6.7, you might have noticed that the bigger the argument you provide, the longer the function takes to run. Furthermore, the run time increases quickly.</p><p>To understand why, consider Figure 11.2, which shows the <strong>call graph</strong> for <code>fibonacci</code> with <code>n = 4</code>:</p><figure>
  <img src="fig112.svg" alt="Call graph.">
  <figcaption>Figure 11.2. Call graph.</figcaption>
</figure><p>A call graph shows a set of function frames, with lines connecting each frame to the frames of the functions it calls. At the top of the graph, <code>fibonacci</code> with <code>n = 4</code> calls <code>fibonacci</code> with  <code>n = 3</code> and <code>n = 2</code>. In turn, <code>fibonacci</code> with <code>n = 3</code> calls <code>fibonacci</code> with <code>n = 2</code> and <code>n = 1</code>. And so on.</p><p>Count how many times <code>fibonacci(0)</code> and <code>fibonacci(1)</code> are called. This is an inefficient solution to the problem, and it gets worse as the argument gets bigger.</p><p>One solution is to keep track of values that have already been computed by storing them in a dictionary. A previously computed value that is stored for later use is called a <strong>memo</strong>. Here is a “memoized” version of fibonacci:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">known = Dict(0=&gt;0, 1=&gt;1)

function fibonacci(n)
    if n ∈ keys(known)
        return known[n]
    end
    res = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    known[n] = res
    res
end</code></pre><p><code>known</code> is a dictionary that keeps track of the Fibonacci numbers we already know. It starts with two items: <code>0</code> maps to <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> maps to <code>1</code>.</p><p>Whenever <code>fibonacci</code> is called, it checks <code>known</code>. If the result is already there, it can return immediately. Otherwise it has to compute the new value, add it to the dictionary, and return it.</p><p>If you run this version of <code>fibonacci</code> and compare it with the original, you will find that it is much faster.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Global-variables-1" href="#Global-variables-1">Global variables</a></h2><p>In the previous example, known is created outside the function, so it belongs to the special frame called <code>__main__</code>. Variables in <code>__main__</code> are sometimes called <strong>global</strong> because they can be accessed from any function. Unlike local variables, which disappear when their function ends, global variables persist from one function call to the next.</p><p>It is common to use global variables for <strong>flags</strong>; that is, boolean variables that indicate (“flag”) whether a condition is true. For example, some programs use a flag named <code>verbose</code> to control the level of detail in the output:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">verbose = true

function example1()
    if verbose
        println(&quot;Running example1&quot;)
    end
end</code></pre><p>If you try to reassign a global variable, you might be surprised. The following example is supposed to keep track of whether the function has been called:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">been_called = false

function example2()
    been_called = true         # WRONG
end</code></pre><p>But if you run it you will see that the value of <code>been_called</code> doesn’t change. The problem is that <code>example2</code> creates a new local variable named <code>been_called</code>. The local variable goes away when the function ends, and has no effect on the global variable.</p><p>To reassign a global variable inside a function you have to <strong>declare</strong> the global variable before you use it:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">been_called = false

function example2()
    global been_called
    been_called = true
end</code></pre><p>The <strong>global statement</strong> tells the interpreter something like, “In this function, when I say <code>been_called</code>, I mean the global variable; don’t create a local one.”</p><p>Here’s an example that tries to update a global variable:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">count = 0

function example3()
    count = count + 1          # WRONG
end</code></pre><p>If you run it you get:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">ERROR: UndefVarError: count not defined</code></pre><p>Julia assumes that <code>count</code> is local, and under that assumption you are reading it before writing it. The solution, again, is to declare <code>count</code> global.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">count = 0

function example3()
    global count
    count += 1
end</code></pre><p>If a global variable refers to a mutable value, you can modify the value without declaring the variable:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">known = Dict(0=&gt;0, 1=&gt;1)

function example4()
    known[2] = 1
end</code></pre><p>So you can add, remove and replace elements of a global array or dictionary, but if you want to reassign the variable, you have to declare it:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">known = Dict(0=&gt;0, 1=&gt;1)

function example5()
    global known
    known = Dict()
end</code></pre><p>Global variables can be useful, but if you have a lot of them, and you modify them frequently, they can make programs hard to debug and perform badly.</p><p>In almost all code (and particularly performance sensitive code) global variables should be declared constant:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">const known = Dict(0=&gt;0, 1=&gt;1)

function fibonacci(n)
    if n ∉ keys(known)
        known[n] = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    end
    known[n]
end</code></pre><p>Here is a function that tries to reassign a <strong>constant global variable</strong>:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">const known = Dict(0=&gt;0, 1=&gt;1)

function example5()
    global known
    known = Dict()
end</code></pre><p>If you run this an exception is generated:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">ERROR: invalid redefinition of constant known</code></pre><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Debugging-1" href="#Debugging-1">Debugging</a></h2><p>As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to debug by printing and checking the output by hand. Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:</p><ul><li><em>Scale down the input</em>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>If possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the program reads a text file, start with just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example you can find. You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the program so it reads only the first n lines. If there is an error, you can reduce n to the smallest value that manifests the error, and then increase it gradually as you find and correct errors.</p></blockquote><ul><li><em>Check summaries and types</em>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>Instead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider printing summaries of the data: for example, the number of items in a dictionary or the total of an array of numbers. A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For debugging this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.</p></blockquote><ul><li><em>Write self-checks</em>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For example, if you are computing the average of an array of numbers, you could check that the result is not greater than the largest element in the array or less than the smallest. This is called a “sanity check” because it detects results that are “insane”. Another kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see if they are consistent. This is called a “consistency check”.</p></blockquote><ul><li><em>Format the output</em>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>Formatting debugging output can make it easier to spot an error. We saw an example in Section 6.9. Again, time you spend building scaffolding can reduce the time you spend debugging.</p></blockquote><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Glossary-1" href="#Glossary-1">Glossary</a></h2><p><em>mapping</em>: A relationship in which each element of one set corresponds to an element of another set.</p><p><em>dictionary</em>: A mapping from keys to their corresponding values.</p><p><em>key-value pair</em>: The representation of the mapping from a key to a value.</p><p><em>item</em>: In a dictionary, another name for a key-value pair.</p><p><em>key</em>: An object that appears in a dictionary as the first part of a key-value pair.</p><p><em>value</em>: An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair.

He came upon a common one-syllable, five-letter word recently that has the following unique property. When you remove the first letter, the remaining letters form a homophone of the original word, that is a word that sounds exactly the same. Replace the first letter, that is, put it back and remove the second letter and the result is yet another homophone of the original word. And the question is, what’s the word?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Now I’m going to give you an example that doesn’t work. Let’s look at the five-letter word, ‘wrack.’ W-R-A-C-K, you know like to ‘wrack with pain.’ If I remove the first letter, I am left with a four-letter word, ’R-A-C-K.’ As in, ‘Holy cow, did you see the rack on that buck! It must have been a nine-pointer!’ It’s a perfect homophone. If you put the ‘w’ back, and remove the ‘r,’ instead, you’re left with the word, ‘wack,’ which is a real word, it’s just not a homophone of the other two words.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of, which will yield two homophones if you remove either of the first two letters to make two, new four-letter words. The question is, what’s the word?</p></blockquote><p>You can use the dictionary from Exercise 11-1 to check whether a string is in the word array.</p><p>To check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary.
