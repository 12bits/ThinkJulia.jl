But the functions we’ve written are all void: they have an effect, like printing a value or moving a turtle, but they return <code>nothing</code>. In this chapter you will learn to write fruitful functions.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Return-values-1" href="#Return-values-1">Return values</a></h2><p>Calling the function generates a return value, which we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an expression.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">e = exp(1.0)
height = radius * sin(radians)</code></pre><p>The functions we have written so far are void. Speaking casually, they have no return value; more precisely, their return value is <code>nothing</code>. In this chapter, we are (finally) going to write fruitful functions. The first example is <code>area</code>, which returns the area of a circle with the given radius:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function area(radius)
    a = π * radius^2
    return a
end</code></pre><p>We have seen the <code>return</code> statement before, but in a fruitful function the <code>return</code> statement includes an expression. This statement means: “Return immediately from this function and use the following expression as a return value.” The expression can be arbitrarily complicated, so we could have written this function more concisely:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function area(radius)
    π * radius^2
end</code></pre><p>The value returned by a function is the value of the last expression evaluated, which, by default, is the last expression in the body of the function definition.</p><p>On the other hand, <strong>temporary variables</strong> like <code>a</code> and explicit <code>return</code> statements can make debugging easier.</p><p>Sometimes it is useful to have multiple <code>return</code> statements, one in each branch of a conditional:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function absvalue(x)
    if x &lt; 0
        return -x
    else
        return x
    end
end</code></pre><p>Since these return statements are in an alternative conditional, only one runs.</p><p>As soon as a <code>return</code> statement runs, the function terminates without executing any subsequent statements. Code that appears after a <code>return</code> statement, or any other place the flow of execution can never reach, is called <strong>dead code</strong>.</p><p>In a fruitful function, it is a good idea to ensure that every possible path through the program hits a return statement. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function absvalue(x)
    if x &lt; 0
        return -x
    end
    if x &gt; 0
        return x
    end
end</code></pre><p>This function is incorrect because if <code>x</code> happens to be 0, neither condition is true, and the function ends without hitting a <code>return</code> statement. If the flow of execution gets to the end of a function, the return value is <code>nothing</code>, which is not the absolute value of 0.</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; println(absvalue(0))
nothing</code></pre><p>By the way, Julia provides a built-in function called <code>abs</code> that computes absolute values.</p><p>As an exercise, write a <code>compare</code> function takes two values, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and returns <code>1</code> if <code>x &gt; y</code>, <code>0</code> if <code>x == y</code>, and <code>-1</code> if <code>x &lt; y</code>.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Incremental-development-1" href="#Incremental-development-1">Incremental development</a></h2><p>As you write larger functions, you might find yourself spending more time debugging.</p><p>To deal with increasingly complex programs, you might want to try a process called <strong>incremental development</strong>. The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.</p><p>As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points, given by the coordinates <span>$(x_1, y_1)$</span> and <span>$(x_2, y_2)$</span>. By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:</p><div>\[d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\]</div><p>The first step is to consider what a distance function should look like in Julia. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?</p><p>In this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent using four numbers. The return value is the distance represented by a floating-point value.</p><p>Immediately you can write an outline of the function:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function distance(x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂)
    0.0
end</code></pre><p>Obviously, this version doesn’t compute distances; it always returns zero. But it is syntactically correct, and it runs, which means that you can test it before you make it more complicated. The subscript numbers are available in the Unicode character encoding (<code>\_1 TAB</code>, <code>\_2 TAB</code>, etc.).</p><p>To test the new function, call it with sample arguments:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">distance(1, 2, 4, 6)</code></pre><p>I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is 3 and the vertical distance is 4; that way, the result is 5, the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle. When testing a function, it is useful to know the right answer.</p><p>At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start adding code to the body. A reasonable next step is to find the differences <span>$x_2 − x_1$</span> and <span>$y_2 − y_1$</span>. The next version stores those values in temporary variables and prints them.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function distance(x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂)
    dx = x₂ - x₁
    dy = y₂ - y₁
    println(&quot;dx is &quot;, dx)
    println(&quot;dy is &quot;, dy)
    0.0
end</code></pre><p>If the function is working, it should display <code>dx</code> is 3 and <code>dy</code> is 4. If so, we know that the function is getting the right arguments and performing the first computation correctly. If not, there are only a few lines to check.</p><p>Next we compute the sum of squares of <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function distance(x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂)
    dx = x₂ - x₁
    dy = y₂ - y₁
    d² = dx^2 + dy^2
    println(&quot;d² is &quot;, d²)
    0.0
end</code></pre><p>Again, you would run the program at this stage and check the output (which should be 25). Superscript numbers are also available (<code>\^2 TAB</code>). Finally, you can use <code>sqrt</code> to compute and return the result:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function distance(x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂)
    dx = x₂ - x₁
    dy = y₂ - y₁
    d² = dx^2 + dy^2
    sqrt(d²)
end</code></pre><p>If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to print the value of <code>sqrt(d²)</code> before the <code>return</code> statement.</p><p>The final version of the function doesn’t display anything when it runs; it only returns a value. The print statements we wrote are useful for debugging, but once you get the function working, you should remove them. Code like that is called <strong>scaffolding</strong> because it is helpful for building the program but is not part of the final product.</p><p>When you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a time. As you gain more experience, you might find yourself writing and debugging bigger chunks. Either way, incremental development can save you a lot of debugging time.</p><p>The key aspects of the process are:</p><ol><li><p>Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.</p></li><li><p>Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.</p></li><li><p>Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program difficult to read.</p></li></ol><p>As an exercise, use incremental development to write a function called <code>hypotenuse</code> that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two legs as arguments. Record each stage of the development process as you go.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Composition-1" href="#Composition-1">Composition</a></h2><p>As you should expect by now, you can call one function from within another. As an example, we’ll write a function that takes two points, the center of the circle and a point on the perimeter, and computes the area of the circle.</p><p>Assume that the center point is stored in the variables <code>xc</code> and <code>yc</code>, and the perimeter point is in <code>xp</code> and <code>yp</code>. The first step is to find the radius of the circle, which is the distance between the two points. We just wrote a function, distance, that does that:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)</code></pre><p>The next step is to find the area of a circle with that radius; we just wrote that, too:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">result = area(radius)</code></pre><p>Encapsulating these steps in a function, we get:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function circlearea(xc, yc, xp, yp)
    radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
    result = area(radius)
    return result
end</code></pre><p>The temporary variables <code>radius</code> and <code>result</code> are useful for development and debugging, but once the program is working, we can make it more concise by composing the function calls:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function circlearea(xc, yc, xp, yp)
    area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp))
end</code></pre><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Boolean-functions-1" href="#Boolean-functions-1">Boolean functions</a></h2><p>Functions can return booleans, which is often convenient for hiding complicated tests inside functions. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function isdivisible(x, y)
    if x % y == 0
        return true
    else
        return false
    end
end</code></pre><p>It is common to give boolean functions names that sound like yes/no questions; <code>isdivisible</code> returns either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> to indicate whether <code>x</code> is divisible by <code>y</code>.</p><p>Here is an example:</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; isdivisible(6, 4)
false
julia&gt; isdivisible(6, 3)
true</code></pre><p>The result of the <code>==</code> operator is a boolean, so we can write the function more concisely by returning it directly:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function isdivisible(x, y)
    x % y == 0
end</code></pre><p>Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">if isdivisible(x, y)
    println(&quot;x is divisible by y&quot;)
end</code></pre><p>It might be tempting to write something like:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">if isdivisible(x, y) == true
    println(&quot;x is divisible by y&quot;)
end</code></pre><p>But the extra comparison is unnecessary.</p><p>As an exercise, write a function <code>isbetween(x, y, z)</code> that returns <code>true</code> if <code>x ≤ y ≤ z</code> or <code>false</code> otherwise.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="More-recursion-1" href="#More-recursion-1">More recursion</a></h2><p>We have only covered a small subset of Julia, but you might be interested to know that this subset is a <em>complete</em> programming language, which means that anything that can be computed can be expressed in this language. Any program ever written could be rewritten using only the language features you have learned so far (actually, you would need a few commands to control devices like the mouse, disks, etc., but that’s all).</p><p>Proving that claim is a nontrivial exercise first accomplished by Alan Turing, one of the first computer scientists (some would argue that he was a mathematician, but a lot of early computer scientists started as mathematicians). Accordingly, it is known as the Turing Thesis. For a more complete (and accurate) discussion of the Turing Thesis, I recommend Michael Sipser’s book <em>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</em>.</p><p>To give you an idea of what you can do with the tools you have learned so far, we’ll evaluate a few recursively defined mathematical functions. A recursive definition is similar to a circular definition, in the sense that the definition contains a reference to the thing being defined. A truly circular definition is not very useful:</p><p><strong>vorpal</strong>: An adjective used to describe something that is vorpal.</p><p>If you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed. On the other hand, if you looked up the definition of the factorial function, denoted with the symbol <span>$!$</span>, you might get something like this:</p><div>\[\begin{aligned}
  0! &amp; = 1 \\
  n! &amp; = n (n-1)!
\end{aligned}\]</div><p>This definition says that the factorial of <span>$0$</span> is <span>$1$</span>, and the factorial of any other value, <span>$n$</span>, is <span>$n$</span> multiplied by the factorial of <span>$n−1$</span>.</p><p>So <span>$3!$</span> is <span>$3$</span> times <span>$2!$</span>, which is <span>$2$</span> times <span>$1!$</span>, which is <span>$1$</span> times <span>$0!$</span>. Putting it all together, <span>$3!$</span> equals <span>$3$</span> times <span>$2$</span> times <span>$1$</span> times <span>$1$</span>, which is <span>$6$</span>.</p><p>If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can write a Julia program to evaluate it. The first step is to decide what the parameters should be. In this case it should be clear that factorial takes an integer:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function fact(n) end</code></pre><p>If the argument happens to be <code>0</code>, all we have to do is return <code>1</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function fact(n)
    if n == 0
        return 1
    end
end</code></pre><p>Otherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make a recursive call to find the factorial of <code>n−1</code> and then multiply it by <code>n</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function fact(n)
    if n == 0
        return 1
    else
        recurse = fact(n-1)
        result = n * recurse
        return result
    end
end</code></pre><p>The flow of execution for this program is similar to the flow of <code>countdown</code> in Section 5.8. If we call <code>fact</code> with the value <code>3</code>:</p><p>Since <code>3</code> is not <code>0</code>, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of <code>n-1</code>...</p><blockquote><p>Since <code>2</code> is not <code>0</code>, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of <code>n-1</code>...</p><blockquote><p>Since <code>1</code> is not <code>0</code>, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of <code>n-1</code>...</p><blockquote><p>Since <code>0</code> equals <code>0</code>, we take the first branch and return <code>1</code> without making any more recursive calls.</p></blockquote><p>The return value, <code>1</code>, is multiplied by <code>n</code>, which is <code>1</code>, and the <code>result</code> is returned.</p></blockquote><p>The return value, <code>1</code>, is multiplied by <code>n</code>, which is <code>2</code>, and the <code>result</code> is returned.</p></blockquote><p>The return value <code>2</code> is multiplied by <code>n</code>, which is <code>3</code>, and the result, <code>6</code>, becomes the return value of the function call that started the whole process.</p><figure>

  <figcaption>Figure 6.1. Stack diagram.</figcaption>
</figure><p>Figure 6.1 shows what the stack diagram looks like for this sequence of function calls.</p><p>The return values are shown being passed back up the stack. In each frame, the return value is the value of <code>result</code>, which is the product of <code>n</code> and <code>recurse</code>.</p><p>In the last frame, the local variables <code>recurse</code> and <code>result</code> do not exist, because the branch that creates them does not run.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Leap-of-faith-1" href="#Leap-of-faith-1">Leap of faith</a></h2><p>Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but it can quickly become overwhelming. An alternative is what I call the “leap of faith”. When you come to a function call, instead of following the flow of execution, you <em>assume</em> that the function works correctly and returns the right result.</p><p>In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use built-in functions. When you call <code>cos</code> or <code>exp</code>, you don’t examine the bodies of those functions. You just assume that they work because the people who wrote the built-in functions were good programmers.</p><p>The same is true when you call one of your own functions. For example, in Section 6.4, we wrote a function called <code>isdivisible</code> that determines whether one number is divisible by another. Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is correct—by examining the code and testing—we can use the function without looking at the body again.</p><p>The same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive call, instead of following the flow of execution, you should assume that the recursive call works (returns the correct result) and then ask yourself, “Assuming that I can find the factorial of <span>$n−1$</span>, can I compute the factorial of <span>$n$</span>?” It is clear that you can, by multiplying by <span>$n$</span>.</p><p>Of course, it’s a bit strange to assume that the function works correctly when you haven’t finished writing it, but that’s why it’s called a leap of faith!</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="One-more-example-1" href="#One-more-example-1">One more example</a></h2><p>After factorial, the most common example of a recursively defined mathematical function is fibonacci, which has the following definition (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number</a>):</p><div>\[\begin{aligned}
    \textit{fib}(0) &amp;= 0 \\
    \textit{fib}(1) &amp;= 1 \\
    \textit{fib}(n) &amp;= \textit{fib}(n-1) + \textit{fib}(n-2)
\end{aligned}\]</div><p>Translated into Julia, it looks like this:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">function fib(n)
    if n == 0
        return 0
    elseif n == 1
        return 1
    else
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    end
end</code></pre><p>If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for fairly small values of <code>n</code>, your head explodes. But according to the leap of faith, if you assume that the two recursive calls work correctly, then it is clear that you get the right result by adding them together.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Checking-types-1" href="#Checking-types-1">Checking types</a></h2><p>What happens if we call <code>fact</code> and give it <code>1.5</code> as an argument?</p><pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; fact(1.5)

We can try to generalize the factorial function to work with floating-point numbers, or we can make <code>fact</code> check the type of its argument.

Factorial is only defined for integers.
nothing
julia&gt; println(fact(-2))
Factorial is not defined for negative integers.
nothing</code></pre><p>If we get past both checks, we know that <code>n</code> is positive or zero, so we can prove that the recursion terminates.</p><p>This program demonstrates a pattern sometimes called a <strong>guardian</strong>. The first two conditionals act as guardians, protecting the code that follows from values that might cause an error. The guardians make it possible to prove the correctness of the code.</p><p>In Section 11.4 we will see a more flexible alternative to printing an error message: raising an exception.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Debugging-1" href="#Debugging-1">Debugging</a></h2><p>Breaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural checkpoints for debugging.
